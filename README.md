# Amazon_Vine_Analysis
Taking a large dataset through the ETL process and performing analysis 

# Overview of the analysis 
The luggage reviews dataset from Amazon Review datasets is extracted from AWS and transformed using PySPark in Google's CoLab. Multiple dataframes are created and uploaded into pgAdmin. Afterwards, the vine_table DataFrame is used to determine if there is any bias between the reviews that are part of the Vine program versus reviews received that are not from the Vine program. Amazon Vine is a product review program. A small fee to Amazon allows companies to provide trusted reviewers with their product and those customers must provide a review.
